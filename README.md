ðŸ“š **A complete roadmap for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** â€“  
This repository is designed to take learners from the very basics of DSA (arrays, strings, recursion, sorting)  
to advanced topics (dynamic programming, graphs, segment trees, tries, and more).  

It contains:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Well-structured notes** for quick revision  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Step-by-step problem-solving approaches**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Multiple solutions** (brute force â†’ optimized)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Code implementations in Java** (and extendable to other languages)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Interview-focused preparation** to crack top tech companies  

Whether youâ€™re a beginner starting with fundamentals or an experienced coder brushing up for coding interviews  
and competitive programming, this repo serves as a **comprehensive preparation guide**.
