ðŸ“š A complete roadmap for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) â€“ This repository is designed to take learners from the very basics of DSA (arrays, strings, recursion, sorting) to advanced topics (dynamic programming, graphs, segment trees, tries, and more). It contains:

  âœ… Well-structured notes for quick revision
  
  âœ… Step-by-step problem-solving approaches
  
  âœ… Multiple solutions (brute force â†’ optimized)
  
  âœ… Code implementations in Java (and extendable to other languages)
  
  âœ… Interview-focused preparation to crack top tech companies

Whether youâ€™re a beginner starting with fundamentals or an experienced coder brushing up for coding interviews and competitive programming, this repo serves as a comprehensive preparation guide.
